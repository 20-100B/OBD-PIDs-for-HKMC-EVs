# OBD PIDs for the Hyundai Ioniq Electric

## How to use:

These codes are primarily for use with Torque Pro which runs on Android phones and tablets. The preferred method of inputting them to the phone is via the plugin, HKMC-EV-Torque-Plugin.
Or this can be done manually. [Setting up Torque to show OBD data on the Ioniq EV](https://jejusoul.github.io/OBD-PIDs-for-HKMC-EVs/)

## List of files: 

OBD PIDs in the extendedpids folder 

- `Hyundai_Ioniq_EV_BMS_data.csv` :- Data from the High Voltage battery.
- `Hyundai_Ioniq_EV_BMS_cell_data` :- The 96 cell voltages of the High Voltage battery.
- `Hyundai_Ioniq_EV_Extra_gauges.csv` :- Extra values calculated from the PID data.

## Tips for the Torque Pro user:
To see temperatures in Fahrenheit change the unit settings in Torque, don't change the file.

## TODO:
Most of the PIDs from the Kia Soul EV are working for Ioniq. Check compatible PID and merge into Ioniq PID.
