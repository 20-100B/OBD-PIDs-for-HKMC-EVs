## How to use:

These codes are primarily for use with Torque Pro which runs on Android phones and tablets. The preferred method of inputting them to the phone is via the plugin, HKMC-EV-Torque-Plugin.
Or this can be done manually. [Setting up Torque to show BMS data on the Ioniq EV](http://myioniq.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=11&t=133)

## Tips for the Torque Pro user:
To see temperatures in Fahrenheit change the unit settings in Torque, don't change the file.

## TODO:
Most of the PIDs from the Kia Soul EV are working for Ioniq. Check compatible PID and merge into Ioniq PID.
