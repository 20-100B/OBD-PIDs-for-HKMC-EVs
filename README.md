# OBD-PIDs-for-HKMC-EVs
OBD PIDs for Hyundai/Kia/Motor/Company Electric Vehicles.
Currently the Hyundai Ioniq Electric, Kia Ray EV and Kia Soul EV

## How to use?
These codes are primarily for use with Torque Pro which runs on Android phones and tablets.
The preferred method of inputting them to the phone is via the plugin, HKMC-EV-Torque-Plugin.
Or this can be done manually. [Setting up Torque to show BMS data](http://www.mykiasoulev.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=6&t=471)

## What hardware do I need
Almost all users are using a Bluetooth Diagnostic Scanner connected to an android phone ot tablet running Torque Pro.
We recommend the Konnwei KW902. See - [recommended obd2 adapter](http://www.mykiasoulev.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=6&t=711)

## What is OBD? What is PID?
OBD is On-Board_Diagnostics. By connecting directly to the car we have access to the status of various vehicle subsystems.
PIDs are the Parameter IDs; these are the codes used to request data from a vehicle
