## What hardware do I need
Almost all users are using a Bluetooth Diagnostic Scanner connected to an android phone ot tablet running Torque Pro.
We recommend the Konnwei KW902. See - [recommended obd2 adapter](http://www.mykiasoulev.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=6&t=711)

Try Engine Link and a LELink - Bluetooth Low Energy OBDII Adapter.
No one has yet tested that this works.
