# OBD PIDs for the Kia Ray EV

## How to use:

These codes are primarily for use with Torque Pro which runs on Android phones and tablets. The preferred method of inputting them to the phone is via the plugin, HKMC-EV-Torque-Plugin.
Or this can be done manually. (Using the Kia Soul EV as an example.)

## List of files: 

OBD PIDs 

- Ray_EV_BMS_data.csv - Data from the High Voltage battery.
- Ray_EV_BMS_cell_data - The 96 cell voltages of the High Voltage battery.

## Tips for the Torque Pro user:
To see temperatures in Fahrenheit change the unit settings in Torque, don't change the file.

## TODO:
Most of the PIDs from the Kia Soul EV are working on the Ray. Check compatible PID and merge into Ray PID.

## Glossary:
The BMS is the Battery Management System for the High Voltage battery.
