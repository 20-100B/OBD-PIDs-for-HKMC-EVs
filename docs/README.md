## Documentation for Helping Users

The instructions on how to install the files, and how to use Torque will be html documentation in the docs folder.
Most users would probably want to see this, not the coding.
This is viewable at [How to use Torque with a Hyundai / Kia EV](https://jejusoul.github.io/OBD-PIDs-for-HKMC-EVs/)
It is much easier to maintain one generic help file, for all the cars using the codes.

## TODO:

- Create a menu structure
